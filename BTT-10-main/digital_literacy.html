<h2>The First Unit</h2>


<p>Digital Literacy is about computers. You are taught all about them! While not everything taught is true in general and doing your own research is always important, the majority appears to be factual. Here are some cherry picked examples of things I find funny (paraphrased): "In order to increase graphical performance, you add more CPUs." and "Coding languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Blockly.". I only have 2 examples and they are not major issues at all. In general it appears to be a good unit, teaching computer basics. As of writing this, pretty fun. Gives me a good amount of time to do Web Dev.</p>
