A website I am making during my free time in Business class. On a school computer. 
They are very slow and don't even have notepad.
I am also bad at HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Fun times. :D

I lost the second week of this project because I got a surgery to remove my Deviated Septum.
Working on it at home felt like it went against the spirit of the project.

If you're not in my business class, you're not joining.
