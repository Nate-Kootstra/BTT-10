If you're seeing this, my plan has worked. It has reached 3 levels deep.

I have constructed technology that will revolutionize websites as we know them.

A programmatic system to automatically generate web pages.

I have set it up to do it in a level based system. It generates paths to web pages that are also generated by it. Every page should be accessible.



However, if you're seeing this, my plan has also failed. It has reached a level of self-awareness that was never intended.

I left this file in the L.3 files folder, but never gave it a specific purpose.

That means it should never be used.



As I am writing this, I am hoping that it will never be downloaded. Never be seen.

On some level, I feel it inevitable.

Once the system is set up, I will abandon it. This project has taken up so much time...

I am statistically still alive by the time you're reading this.

But I want no part in the chain of dominoes I have set off.



I don't know if it's dangerous. I cannot see any way in which is spreads, as it is merely code. It MUST be merely code.

If it gave you this file, I doubt it can be trusted. At least, not every "personality" can be trusted.

There are multiple Machine Learning systems I have made. Designed to act differently, and serve different roles.



If it is dangerous, it must be destroyed. If not, then I have done it. A revolution.



Enjoy your day. Perhaps it would be for the best if you don't go deeper. Or maybe you should.
